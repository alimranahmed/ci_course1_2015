Consider a simple restaurant, you have a list of food(e.g. rice, fish, dall etc.)
You have customer...
1. Customers have there own choice.
2. They will ask you for their food choice(by now, take a variable to store customer's choice)
3. If you have that food, then serve him(I mean, print "Yes sir, you food is ready!");
4. If you dont have, you just tell him ("Sorry sir, this food is not in our stock. please tell us if you have any other choice")
